<h1>The NAIST Project for Interns (NAPI) Program</h1>

<p>
  The NAIST Project for Interns (NAPI) offers yearly internship opportunities
  for students coming from the School of Science and Engineering (SOSE) of the
  Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) in the Philippines. The internship is held
  in the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), a school for graduate
  studies situated in the advanced technology research area of Osaka-Nara-Kyoto.
</p>

<p>
  NAIST is an institution of higher learning that ranks among the best in Japan.
  It is a school that fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, autonomy, and
  independent thinking. Interns will find that the school provides rich research
  exposure and opportunities within its laboratories.
</p>

<p>
  In 2006, NAPI was first held as part of the Excellent Student Program of the
  Graduate School of Information Science, now the Division of Information
  Science. This program allows students of good academic standing to submit
  proposals for a project that the school is going to fund.
</p>

<p>
  Edison Yu, an alumni of ADMU, submitted the proposal for a project that would
  allow NAIST to promote itself abroad and at the same time give students and
  faculty members from the partner university a chance to be immersed in the
  latest technologies and research activities in the institute. The project
  allowed several students and faculty members from the Departments of
  Electronics, Computer, and Communications Engineering and Department of
  Information Systems and Computer Science of ADMU to visit NAIST in 2006.
</p>

<p>
  Since then, NAPI has become a yearly project for both universities and has
  also encouraged a good number of students to pursue graduate studies in NAIST.
  It continues to strengthen the relationship between the two universities in
  terms of research and collaborations.
